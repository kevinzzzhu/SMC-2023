# Sound and Music Computing: Assessment Submission Repository

<https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/laptop-ensemble/assessments/>

This repository is to help you organise your code, patches, and reflections during the semester. You **must** use a fork of this repository to generate the PDF files needed to submit assessment items.

If you're a student in Sound and Music Computing, there are a few things you need to do to get started.

## Once-off

1. fork this project to your own "uid" [GitLab](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/)
   account

2. when you fork it, make sure that you don't change the name

## Every week

1. add your diary reflections to the relevant `week-N` folders 

2. commit & **push** them to GitLab

3. add your diary video to the `diary-week-N` folder on Teams.

## For the assessment items

1. follow the instructions on the assessment page to see which files you need to update

2. commit & **push** them to GitLab

3. read the assessment instructions again to check and ask for help if you need it :-)

_Note_: you can push as many times as you like---your last push before the due
date/time counts as your submission. So push early, push often, and you can
chill out when you spill coffee on your laptop an hour before the submission
deadline :)

## Getting help

If you've been in other COMP courses, then this stuff is probably pretty
familiar. If you haven't been in a COMP course before that's ok too---the git
stuff in this course isn't tricky at all (you can do pretty much all of it
through GitLab's drag-and-drop web interface if you want to).

If you have any questions/problems, ask us on Teams _ASAP_ so we can help you
out before the deadline.
