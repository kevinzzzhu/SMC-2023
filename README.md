# Sound and Music Computing: Assessment Submission Repository

<https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/laptop-ensemble/assessments/>

This repository is to help you organise your code, patches, and reflections during the semester. You **must** use a fork of this repository to generate the PDF files needed to submit assessment items.

If you're a student in Sound and Music Computing, there are a few things you need to do to get started.

## Once-off (workshop 1)

1. fork this project to your own "uid" [GitLab](https://gitlab.cecs.anu.edu.au/)
   account

2. when you fork it, make sure that you don't change the name

## Every week

1. add your diary reflections to the relevant `week-N` folders 

2. commit & **push** them to GitLab

3. add your diary video to the `diary-week-N` folder on Teams.

## For each assessment item

1. follow the instructions on the [assessment page](https://comp.anu.edu.au/courses/laptop-ensemble/assessments/) to see which files you need to update, and the process for submission 

2. commit and **push** your changes to GitLab

3. wait for the CI/CD jobs to complete (click CI/CD and then Jobs in the left sidebar)

4. download the artefact (PDF file) for the assessment item you are working on.

5. check if it looks right, if not go back to step 1.

6. submit the PDF artefact as documented in the assessment instructions (probably on Wattle)

_Note_: you can push as many times as you like and all versions are backed up on GitLab with 
the time and date that you pushed it. Push early, push often, and you can
chill out when you spill coffee on your laptop an hour before the submission
deadline :)

## Getting help

If you've been in other COMP courses, then this stuff is probably pretty
familiar. If you haven't been in a COMP course before that's ok too---the git
stuff in this course isn't tricky at all (you can do pretty much all of it
through GitLab's drag-and-drop web interface if you want to).

If you have any questions/problems, ask us on Teams _ASAP_ so we can help you
out before the deadline.
