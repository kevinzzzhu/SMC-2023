# Week 3 reflection

This week, I mainly focused on implementing multiple audio track sampling and using delay to play them one by one. My inspiration for this project came from "North Memphis" by Pharmacist, a fast-paced Phonk music track. The theme this week reminded me of how much I enjoy Ed Sheeran's live performances, where he creates ensemble performances by recording different instruments and adding echo effects. 
The biggest challenge I faced was not being able to simulate drum sounds and achieve the Phonk effect like in "North Memphis". I tried, but unfortunately ended up with nothing. I only got a Pop and Pip sound, which is totally not I want. This is one of the reasons that makes the current sound is too monotonous, lacking depth and storytelling. I need to use line and vline~ to create an envelope with 4 slopes for the sound, instead of just having a plain straight line on the graph. This will make the sound more full and layered, rather than abruptly dropping to 0 frequency using select.
In addition, my attempt to slow down and speed up the audio was unsuccessful, so I plan to seek help during the workshop.
