# Week 4 reflection

For this week’s dairy, since the request asking for a single source piece, and from me understand I shouldn’t be doing a piece that is complicated pieces. After hanging my mind, I decided to gradually accelerate the metro and try to change the tone of the envelope in play, so that the work was less monotonous, and later added to playing drum. The piece is inspired by jazz songs, and I admire the slow rhythm it has, so I would like to create a similar one myself, which also suits this week’s theme. I use spigot as the main controller, opening a switch-rich work as the work goes on. The small envelope of the first beat and the big envelop of the third beat in the piece form a contrast. I deliberately increased the release phase of the small envelope and reduced the volume, while the larger Envelope I played instantaneously with three osc with delays to simulate echo, and intentionally shortened the release phase and expanded the sustenance phase. The second and fourth beats are also related. If they are dropped together (fourth then second beat), a complete envelope can be obtained.
