# Portfolio 2 Discussion
## Intro
In the past four weeks, with the help of my teammates, teachers, and friends, I have made continuous progress in my understanding of music and computer music. While challenging myself with the fresh Gibber, I also consolidated my knowledge of Puredata and revisited p5js and various plugins that I had learned before. Overall, this four-week learning journey has been extremely beneficial to me.
## Discussion
**As a group**, I have learned more about collaborating with others to create music. It's important not to impose your own ideas on everyone, but to take in everyone's suggestions. In Week 9's group diary, we got to know each other's strengths and weaknesses through multiple meetings and helped each other progress. For example, Wangshu had no knowledge of music but was familiar with coding, while Noah was a music major but the opposite. In the end, each of us had a more comprehensive understanding of music and coding. In addition, collaborating with different people during workshops has helped me improve. Expressing my own ideas, listening to others' suggestions, and working together to create unknown works through live coding.

**As an individual**, I have tried many extracurricular activities, such as connecting Microbit, learning and using p5js, Processing, and Gem. Every time I see my classmates mastering knowledge that I don't know in class, I will ask them for their patches, hoping that I can use them next time. Whenever I get stuck, I ask my teammates on Teams, and they patiently help me solve the problem. 
Like in the week 6, it showcases the ability to adapt existing code to create a new interface. I experimented with different tools and techniques to connect the Microbit and create Gem animations. I tried to highlight the author's technical skills, especially in working with different technologies.
It's clear that my learning journey has been a gradual process. The UI exploration I did in solo performance has been carried over to Puredata later on, while the music production skills I learned in Gibber as part of a group will definitely be used in my final performance.
