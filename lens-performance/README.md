# LENS Performance materials

Make sure that all the important files and resources needed to perform your lens performance are in this folder. Fill in the `lens-performance-notes.md` to document your performance, here's a TODO list to help:

- [✅] change the heading at the top of the `lens-performance-notes.md` file to the name of your LENS performance and your name.
- [✅] write a paragraph or so in the _Description_ section explaining the main idea of your performance.
- [ ] list the important files or resources required to make the performance work (and why) in the _Files and Resources_ section.
- [✅] provide step-by-step instructions for making it work in the _Usage_ section (your audience is a fellow LENS member)
- [ ] make sure you have included screenshots or code excerpts from important parts of your work.
- [✅] add any other sections which make sense to explain further how your performance works (e.g. _Performance Structure_, _Composition_,  _Caveats_, _Cool things to try_)
- [✅] make sure you have at least two references.
